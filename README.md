# System-Identification-and-PID-Control
This is an individual assignment done under the module EN2143 Electronic Control Systems, Semester 4, Department of Electronic &amp; Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Task description of the assignment is as follows.

Note: use a transfer function of order greater than 2 with at least one zero for data generation. Use the two sample codes given to generate your data and implement PID controller.

Steps to follow

  1. Open System Identification App, import time domain data, set input and output, set start time and sample time.
  2. Visualize whether the imported data is as same as generated data.
  3. In estimate -> area, select transfer function models, select number of poles and zeros, select continuous time, set delay.
  4. Check model output and data fitting percentage.
  5. Bring the modelled transfer function to workspace.
  6. Design a PID controller for the model and verify/comment on the performance.
  7. Draw the root locus of the controlled plant and comment on the pole placement.
